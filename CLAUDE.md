## Project

**grrt** is a general relativistic ray tracer in Java 21, built with Maven. It
simulates null geodesics in curved spacetime to produce black hole images. The
end goal is a Research Notes of the AAS (RNAAS) paper using photon-ring
asymmetry as a diagnostic of the Johannsen-Psaltis (JP) prograde photon-sphere
bifurcation at M87*-consistent spin. Two coupled results:

1. A two-sided bound on ε₃ extracted from the smooth-deformation regime
   (ε₃ ∈ (ε₃_pathology, ε₃_crit) at a = 0.9, approximately (−2.97, +0.12))
   by interpolating δ_r/⟨r⟩ against EHT Paper VI Table 7 circularity.
2. A prediction, testable by future higher-precision observations, of a
   qualitative shadow-structure change at ε₃_crit ≈ 0.12 for a = 0.9:
   above the cusp the prograde side of the shadow is bounded by the event
   horizon itself, not by a photon sphere.

**Phases**
1. Schwarzschild ray tracer with fixed-step RK4. (current)
2. Kerr metric, adaptive Dormand-Prince, disk emission.
3. Johannsen-Psaltis metric, photon-ring asymmetry sweep (smooth regime + cusp), EHT comparison, RNAAS paper.

**Hardware target:** MacBook Pro M3, 16 GB. macOS aarch64.

The architecture is four classes talking through small interfaces. Each
`Metric` is a drop-in replacement; the integrator, camera, and renderer
never branch on metric type. Preserving this is how Kerr and JP get added
as single-file extensions later.

## Physics conventions (do not drift from these)

- **Signature:** (-, +, +, +)
- **Units:** geometrized, G = c = 1. Mass M has dimensions of length; default M = 1.
- **Coordinates:** (t, r, θ, φ) with indices 0, 1, 2, 3.
- **State vector (length 8):** `[t, r, θ, φ, k^t, k^r, k^θ, k^φ]`
- **Affine parameter:** λ. Trace null geodesics forward in λ (h > 0) from
  the observer; by time-symmetry of the geodesic equation, the traced
  curve is the reverse of the physical photon's path. Intersections with
  horizon, disk, or celestial sphere identify the source.
- **Null condition:** `g_{μν} k^μ k^ν = 0`. Monitored for numerical drift.

**Schwarzschild landmarks (used in tests):**
- Horizon: r = 2M
- Photon sphere: r = 3M
- Critical impact parameter: b_crit = 3√3 M ≈ 5.196 M

**Kerr landmarks (Phase 2):**
- Outer horizon: r₊ = M + √(M² - a²)
- Ergosphere (equator): r_ergo = 2M
- Prograde ISCO varies with spin

If you are uncertain about a sign, index ordering, or unit, stop and ask.
Silent guessing in GR will introduce bugs that take hours to find.

## Coding rules

- Java 21. Use records where they help, not cosmetically.
- State vectors are `double[]`. No `Vector4` class. No boxing.
- No DI frameworks. No Spring. Plain constructors.
- No new dependencies without approval. `nom-tam-fits` and JUnit are it.
- All public APIs have Javadoc stating physical meaning, units, and valid
  domain (e.g. "requires r > 2M").
- Christoffels are computed in closed form per metric, derived by hand, with
  the derivation in Javadoc. Never numerical differentiation.
- `Metric.geodesicAcceleration` has a correctness default but every concrete
  metric overrides it with a sparsity-exploiting version.
- The `Metric` interface has been extended in Phase 3B with two `default`
  methods that throw or fall back to a position-independent approximation;
  concrete metrics override as needed:
  - `iscoRadius(boolean prograde)` — defaults to throwing
    `UnsupportedOperationException`; overridden by `KerrMetric` and
    `JohannsenPsaltisMetric` (added 3B.1).
  - `isInsideHorizon(double[] x, double tol)` — defaults to
    `r - horizonRadius() < tol`; overridden by `JohannsenPsaltisMetric`
    with the position-dependent test `Δ + a² h sin²θ ≤ tol` (added 3B.2).
- Fail loudly on invalid input (`IllegalArgumentException`). Do not let NaN
  propagate silently.

**Hot-path rules (integrator inner loop):**
- No allocation inside `Integrator.step`. Use pre-allocated scratch arrays.
- No lambdas, streams, or boxing.
- Integrators hold scratch buffers and are **not** thread-safe. One instance
  per worker thread.

**Parallelism:** pixel loop only. Parallel streams or `ForkJoinPool`.

---

## Testing rules

- JUnit 5. Test files mirror source: `src/test/java/.../FooTest.java` for
  `src/main/java/.../Foo.java`.
- Every new `Metric` requires tests for:
  1. Metric × inverse = identity
  2. Christoffel symmetry in lower indices
  3. Asymptotic behavior (flat limit, horizon limit)
  4. At least one closed-form physical prediction (e.g. circular photon orbit)
- Every new `Integrator` requires:
  1. Straight-line test in Minkowski
  2. Closed-orbit preservation in Schwarzschild
  3. Null-condition drift bound
  4. Input validation
- Tolerances:
  - Algebraic identities: `1e-12`
  - Short integration (< 1 orbital period): `1e-6`
  - Long integration: state explicit tolerance in the test name

**When a test fails, debug the cause. Do not relax the tolerance.**

## Session Hygiene

At any major checkpoint — sub-phase complete, end-of-session, before
`/compact`, before `Ctrl+D`, or before any pause longer than ~30 minutes —
write current state to `docs/phase-Nx-status.md` where `Nx` is the current
sub-phase (e.g. `phase-3a-status.md`). Include:

- Files modified this session with brief summaries.
- Review items resolved / in-progress / pending, with evidence.
- Current `mvn test` results.
- Any open diff prompts or pending tool calls.
- The exact next action to take on resume.

Do not commit the status file unless the sub-phase is complete and tagged;
uncommitted status files are fine and survive compaction, terminal close,
and laptop reboot.

## Agent behavior expectations

- **Produce compiling, tested code.** No placeholders, no pseudocode, no
  "TODO: implement this". If a dependency is missing, say so instead of
  inventing it.
- **Never add a dependency silently.** Surface it for approval first.
- **Never relax a test tolerance to make a test pass.** Find the cause.
- **Run `mvn test` before claiming a change is done.** If you cannot run it
  in this environment, say so explicitly.
- **State complexity.** Numerical routines get a time/space complexity note
  in Javadoc.
- **Derive, don't guess.** For new metrics, show the Christoffel derivation
  in the Javadoc before coding the tensor.
- **Prefer fewer files.** This codebase is intentionally small.
- **Ask when a change would touch the `Metric` interface.** It is the
  load-bearing abstraction for Phases 2-3.
- **No attribution trailers in commit messages.** Do not add
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude`, `Generated with Claude Code`, or any similar
  footer. Commits carry only the subject line and body the user specifies.
